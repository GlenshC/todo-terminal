help with invalid command usage 
DOCUMENT -r --reverse as sorting in descending order
DOCUMENT --sort -s and -E in list/sorting

list filters (like showing only the specific priorities or filtering out whats done)
add age decay for no deadline (increases the points 1pt/week) (might need to balance it out)
waste items always ties so maybe introduce -+5pts randomness

fix:
edit string sizes not changed after edit

fixed:
free_todolist

FASTER edit, remove, view when id arg is provided (skips sorting)

! ADD SAVE DIR. (because its saving on where the current working dir of the terminal)

todo version
bin serialization version (for updating the app) // byte alignment
