ADD:
TODO LIST PAGES MAX 1024 ITEMS PER PAGE (implement reading and writing)
TODO LIST GROW, because its like a static size, change to dynamically resizing stream OR periodic stream flushing when add new
DOCUMENT -r --reverse as sorting in descending order
DOCUMENT --sort -s and -E in list/sorting
Add filtering  --filter "key=value,ket2=value2"
help with invalid command usage

list filters (like showing only the specific priorities or filtering out whats done)
add age decay for no deadline (increases the points 1pt/week) (might need to balance it out)
waste items always ties so maybe introduce -+5pts randomness

REDESIGN:

fix:

---------------------------------------------
fixed:
strlen desc and title overflow
edit string sizes not changed after edit
free_todolist

ADDED
add [todo done | todo undo]?
CHANGE FROM OVERLY ENGINEERED BSTed index sorting TO QSORTed index sorting
added QSORT
soring arg from --priority to --sort priority or -s priority
FASTER edit, remove, view when id arg is provided (skips sorting)
add list args descending and ascending (-r | --reverse)
optimize save file (see devlog)
list.priority can be stored as 2bits (see devlog)
! ADD SAVE DIR. (because its saving on where the current working dir of the terminal)
todo edit - editing must accept words as input on priority
todo rm args
todo edit args
(limit max string lenth %padding.maxs)
todo rm/edit/get/random prompts user input even when no items
todo view
todo version
bin serialization version (for updating the app) // byte alignment
displaying strings can destroy UI 
bin serialization:
    created, deadline stored in 32 bits
    priority stored in 2 bits
    done stored in 1 bit
