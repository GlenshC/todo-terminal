future additions:
    usual stuff we do
    routine?

Redesign:
    priority system
    ugent and important

Priority
0 = urgent important (Critical)
1 = not urgent important (Growth) --[DEFAULT]
2 = urgent not important (Distraction)
3 = not urgent not important (Waste)

Get Algorithm
    0, 1, 2, 3 priority
    get random:
        based on weigth of the quadrants
        default:
            20%
            60%
            20%
            0%
        waste of time allowed:
            18%
            58%
            18%
            6%
        
    get normal ask for:
        energy levels:
            high: q1
            med: 
            low

        do you want to be productive?
            if yes force quadrant 0 or 1:
                25%
                75%
                0%
                0%
            else
